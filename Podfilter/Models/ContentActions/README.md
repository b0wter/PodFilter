Description
===========
ContentActions are actions that are performed on values rather than the podcast itself.
That means that in order to use a ContentAction you need to retrieve a XElement from a pocast first.

An example for an action is the AddStringContentAction which simply adds a pre- and/or a suffix to a given string.
